Step 1 
     -Identified UFO & BIGFOOT Dataset in Kaggle; Aligned with team to focus on only UFO dataset due to data size
    - Established CSV file and loaded on the group repo
    - Define Dependecies via jupyter notebook
    - Cleaned Data 
        - Dropped 2 columns as they were not required in the data set (duration (hours/min), date posted)
        - Aligned on dropping ~ 10K lines of data as there was missing city, state in the file 
        - Validated that there was no missing empty cells in the dataset
        - Re-established a new index count of the data
